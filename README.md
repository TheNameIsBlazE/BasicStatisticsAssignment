# BasicStatisticsAssignment
My second major programming assignment from Grade 11 Computer Science!  I was really proud of this one after I did it.  It's just a program to calculate the mean, median and mode of an array that's read in from a file!  There's a couple other restrictions we had to have on the values too.  I made it in May 2022 or so.
